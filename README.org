There is a demonstration of utilising GIS tools such as a shapefile
viewer which uses the [[http://geotools.org/][geotools API]].  This can be found in the
=grafter.gis.shape-viewer= namespace.

To run this run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (show-shapefile (io/file "./test-data/dclg-enterprise-zones/National_EZ_WGS84.shp"))
#+END_SRC
