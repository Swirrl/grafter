# Grafter

    "For the hard graft of linked data processing."

Grafter is a library, DSL and suite of tools for flexible, efficient,
ETL, data transformation and processing.  Its primary use is for
handling relatively Linked Data conversions from tabular data formats
into RDF linked data format, but it is equally adept at handling
tabular data conversions.

And is being used to transform lots of data for our clients at
[Swirrl](http://swirrl.com/).

See the official grafter website at [grafter.org](http://grafter.org/)
for more details.

For the Grafter rationale see our blog post:
