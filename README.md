# Grafter

    "For the hard graft of linked data processing."

Grafter is a library, DSL and suite of tools for flexible, efficient,
ETL, data transformation and processing.  Its primary use is for
handling Linked Data conversions from tabular data formats into RDF
linked data format, but it is equally adept at handling tabular data
conversions.

See the official grafter website at [grafter.org](http://grafter.org/)
for more details.

For the Grafter rationale see our blog post:
[The hard graft of Linked Data ETL](http://blog.swirrl.com/articles/linked-data-etl/).

## What plans are there for Grafter?

Grafter is currently in the early stages of development, however
[Swirrl](http://swirrl.com/) has been using it to transform
significant amounts of data for our clients within the government.

Grafter is currently an API and a small DSL for converting tabular
data into Linked Data.  However we have ambitious plans to develop a
suite of tools on top of it.  These tools are planned to include:

1. Command line tools for data processing.
1. Import services to load pipelines and execute predefined data
   transformations.
1. A Graphical ETL Tool to assist non-programmers in creating data
   transformation pipelines.

## Development

Grafter is deployed on the standard Clojure build repository
[Clojars](http://clojars.org/).

To use the Grafter API please add the following to your Clojure
projects `project.clj` file.  For more details on how to do this see
the [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) build tool:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/grafter/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/grafter)

**NOTE:** We are currently following a `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` versioning
scheme, but are anticipating significant breaking API changes between
minor versions at least until we reach `1.0.0`.

`PATCH` versions should be backwardly compatible with previous `MINOR`
versions.

Releases will be tagged with an appropriate tag indicating their
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version.

We are currently producing API docs for the master branch and all
tagged releases.

- [API docs (master branch)](http://api.grafter.org/master)
- [API docs (all releases)](http://api.grafter.org/)

Additionally [grafter.org](http://grafter.org/) contains a
[quick start guide](http://grafter.org/getting-started/index.html) and
supplementary documentation.
